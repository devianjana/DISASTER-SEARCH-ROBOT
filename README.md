# DISASTER-SEARCH-ROBOT
In this project i m planning to build an automotive robot which will help people to assist in finding humans that are trapped ,because of the disaster
till now i have created two files, and downloaded all the necessary files and will continue to make changes in the code as of now i have used the help of ai bot to help me in coding like to find the error and in helping me to solve it. We all know that in india landslides are so common as human we have limitations in identifying another human presence. Their are disaster robots yet we are not executing it because of the failures such as it might be some technical error softare failure,hardware failure,battery etc. So my idea is simple yet i guess most reliable one,here we are building a robot which can adjust itself according to the terrain its running, it will be legged robot with tracked soles including a deployable drone for clear vision to understand the situation for both the robot and human.
So in the coding part we mainly focuse on identifying human peresence , analyzing the situation  creating simple maps for easy access to the area. I m using yolov3.weights,yolov3.cfg,coco.names,numpy,os etc. So my progess will be updated soon
